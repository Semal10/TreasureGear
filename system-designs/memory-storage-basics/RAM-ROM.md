RAM -> Volatile memory used by application, loses data when powered off.
ROM -> Persistent memory used to store important things like firmware, bios that the os needs to boot up


RAM Types
1) SRAM -> Fast and expensive RAM, used in CPU cache where quick access time is crucial
2) DRAM -> Slow and cheap RAM

Firmware -> Software that controls how hardware device communicates with each other
BIOS -> Basic I/O System is the first software the os run when it boots up, also inits hardware components, handing control to os

Disk Storage
HDD -> Spinning Magnetic Disk, large storage at cheap price
SSD -> Solid State Drive, use NAND-based flash memory, faster data access and expensive, reduced power consumption and increased durability
USB -> Plug and play device
SD Cards -> Compact size for smartphones
